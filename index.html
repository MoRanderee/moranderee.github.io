                    <h4>Elections Website</h4>
                    <p>
                        Using Python together with the Django framework, I developed a dynamic voting website tailored for a political
                        campaign. The website, encompassing a voting system and a pivotal SQLite database-driven component, boasts a
                        user login and authentication system as well. This endeavor served as a comprehensive application of the skills
                        acquired throughout my bootcamp.
